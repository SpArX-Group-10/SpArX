# SpArX: Sparse Argumentative eXplanations for Neural Networks

## Packages:
Please use the "all" virtual environment provided here. It has customized version of torchvision 
that supports Iris, Cancer and COMPAS dataset. The python version is 3.6. 

## Datasets:
1. COMPAS Dataset
2. Cancer Dataset (UCI)
3. Iris dataset

## Experiments
For each dataset, there are three python files. One for global explanation, one for local explanation to measure unfaithfulness and one for local explanation to measure structural unfaithfulness. 

## Naming Convention of Python Files
The python files are named based on the dataset name, global/local explanation and whether it is used to measure unfaithfulness or structural unfaithfulness.
That is DatasetName_global/local_explanations (for (structural) unfaithfulness)
Please, run each of these python files to produce the results for SpArX (our) method. This will provide the results in Tables 1, 2 and 3. 

### Visualization
Running python files generate graphical visualization of the neural networks. One for the original MLP and one for the clustered MLP. 
The directory of the graphs are dataset_global/local_graphs(original/shrunken_model)

 
### Computing unfaithfulness for LIME 
We use lime_tabular from lime python library (https://github.com/marcotcr/lime). 
Currently the explain_instance function use the label=1 which means that it only considers output node number 1 and not all of the output neurons.
  To change that you should consider using label=[0,1,2] for iris dataset, label=[0, 1] for cancer dataset and label=[0] for compas dataset. and compute the predictions of the regression model used
            in LIME that is Ridge model from sklearn using all the outputs from all the nodes you can compare the predictions of the original model and the
            regressor.
            then change the last lines in explain_instance function as follows:
            
            unfaithfulness = np.sum(list(ret_exp.score.values()))
            if self.mode == "regression":
                 ret_exp.intercept[1] = ret_exp.intercept[0]
                 ret_exp.local_exp[1] = [x for x in ret_exp.local_exp[0]]
                 ret_exp.local_exp[0] = [(i, -1 * j) for i, j in ret_exp.local_exp[1]]
             return ret_exp, unfaithfulness
             also add a new way for computing scores in lime_base.py as follows:
             new_score = np.sum(
                 np.multiply(np.power(easy_model.predict(neighborhood_data[:, used_features]) - labels_column, 2),
                             weights / np.sum(weights)))
             and return new_score in addition to prediction_score


This way we can compute the unfaithfulness of LIME method.

### Model Compression Technique (HAP)
Please use the "all" virtual environment in the HAP-main project provided here. 
It has customized version of torchvision 
that supports Iris, Cancer and COMPAS dataset. The python version is 3.6. 

Please download the HAP project from this link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RjhPlKdHNHO738kt70_phtlO8z85Lay-/view

This project uses the code from GitHub repository of Hessian-Aware Pruning (HAP) paper.

We have included HAP-main.rar file in this project, it has an additional python file to compute (structural) unfaithfulness. 
Please extract is as a separate project and for each dataset (dataset_name = iris, cancer, compas) run the python codes as follows:

* python main_pretrain --batch_size 2 --learning_rate 0.001 --weight_decay 0.00002 --dataset dataset_name --epoch 200 --neurons 50
Now set different prunning ratios and run the following script. Here, we have used 0.2 ratio. In the experiments, we have used 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8 ratio. 
* python main_prune --network mlp --depth 2 --dataset dataset_name --batch-size 8 --learning-rate 0.001 --weight-decay 4e-4 --ratio 0.2 --use-decompose 0 --gpu "0" --neurons 50
